&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important things to know is that the best Achiever
 of life are the best Conquerors of Pains and Misfortune.Remember, before you become an achiever, there are somethings
to understand,because the wise one says,If you fail to plan,you will plan to fail so also have it in mind 
"If you can't fly run, If you can't run walk, If you can't crawl by all means keep on moving until you get to High Level".I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am so glad to say this for you to become an Achiever, first 
thing to have is <b>"Determination"</b> an adage says <i>"If you can't fly run, If you can't run walk, If you can't crawl by 
all means keep on moving until you get to High Level and become an Achiever".</i> <b>MY ACHIEVEMENT.</b><br>
